import sys

'''

The sys module is how you can interact with certain objects
which the Python interpreter itself has access to, 
particularly things like command-line arguments,
stdin, stdout, and stderr, modules,
and information about the runtime environment, 
like the operating system and Python version.
It can also be used for debugging.

In this program, we are just using it
to grab any command-line arguments the user might pass.
But in the beginning, we may not even need that.
